# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Use SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to the SQLite database.
* Use SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.
* Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
* Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis.

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Design a Flask API based on the queries just developed.
